# Neptune OS
Neptune OS is a fake Operating System.

I call it a fake os because it has the same structure as an os. It has a bootloader and kernel.

Bootl is the boot file for linux and bootw is the boot file for windows. I dont know if bootw works though.

# How to use
## Linux
### Normal
Download the latest release and run it (lol)

### Compiling
Download the source and then install gcc and nasm and then go into your terminal and run `make` in the directory you put neptune in.

If it doesnt work then install makefile I think it comes preinstalled with linux tho.

You can also just run compile.sh and run the file it gave you.

## Windows/Mac
Just run makefile on windows it will detect that your on windows

Also for now there wont be a compile.ps1
