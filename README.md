# Neptune OS
Neptune OS is a fake Operating System.

I call it a fake os because it has the same structure as an os. It has a bootloader and kernel.

# How to use
## Linux
### Normal
Download the latest release and run it (lol)

### Compiling
Download the source and then install gcc and nasm and then run compile.sh and run the file it gave you.

## Windows/Mac
I dont think I'll ever add support for windows or mac cuz this is just a personal project I made for fun but you can figure out how to compile it for your platform ig.
