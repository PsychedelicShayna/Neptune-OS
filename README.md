# Neptune OS
Neptune OS is a fake Operating System.

I call it a fake os because it has the same structure as an os. It has a bootloader and kernel.

# How to use
## Linux
### Normal
Download the latest release and run it (lol)

### Compiling
Download the source and then install gcc and nasm and then go into your terminal and run `make` in the directory you put neptune in.

If it doesnt work then install makefile I think it comes preinstalled with linux tho.

You can also just run compile.sh and run the file it gave you.

## Windows/Mac
I dont think I'll ever add support for windows or mac cuz this is just a personal project I made for fun.

Also if you want to run this on windows you will have to modify boot.asm a bit.

Feel free to make a pull request with a modified version that works on all os's.
